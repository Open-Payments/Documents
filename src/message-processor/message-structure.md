# Message Structure

The Message Structure defines the JSON format used by the Open Payments system to handle incoming messages. This structure is **generic** and can adapt to various standards depending on the domain of use.

When the Message Processor is used for payment-related messages, **ISO 20022** is used as the standard within the `data` section. However, if the processor is used in other systems, this structure can accommodate other standardized formats in the `data` section, making it flexible for multiple use cases.

The **root-level fields** contain essential attributes that the message processing product understands. Domain-specific data is encapsulated within the `metadata` and `data` sections, which the workflows interpret and act upon as needed.

## Schema Definition

```json
{
    "id": "string",                   // Unique identifier for the message, generated by the message processing system.

    "payload": "string",              // Original incoming message in its raw form; kept unaltered for reference and traceability.

    "tenant": "string",               // Identifier for the tenant (useful in multi-tenant setups for isolating data).

    "origin": "string",               // Source or origin of the message (e.g., system/channel name).

    "data": {                         // Contains domain-specific data; ISO20022-compliant for payments, or another standard as applicable.
        // Fields specific to the chosen standard (e.g., ISO20022 fields for payments, or other standard-compliant fields for different domains).
    },

    "status": "string",               // Current status of the message in the processing pipeline (e.g., "pending", "processed", "failed").

    "retries": integer,               // Count of retry attempts if processing encountered an error.

    "metadata": {                     // Contains domain-specific metadata and contextual information.
        "format_version": "string",   // Version of the data format used in the `data` object (e.g., "ISO20022:v1").
        "type": "string",             // Type of message (e.g., payment type, transaction category), understood by the workflow.
        "priority": "string",         // Optional priority level for processing (e.g., "real-time", "queued", "scheduled").
        "tags": ["string"],           // Optional tags for categorization (e.g., ["international", "urgent"]).
        "flags": {                    // Flags or indicators for special handling, as per domain needs.
            "requires_urgent_review": true
        }
        // Additional contextual fields relevant to the workflow can be added here.
    },

    "auditlog": [                     // Array of audit log entries, recording each action taken on the message.
        {
            "timestamp": "string",    // Timestamp of when the action occurred.
            "hash": "string",         // Hash of the message state at this step, for integrity verification.
            "workflow": "string",     // Workflow name or identifier associated with this action.
            "task": "string",         // Task or step within the workflow (e.g., "enrichment", "validation").
            "description": "string",  // Description of the action performed at this step.
            "instance": "string"      // Instance ID of the service handling this action (useful in distributed environments).
        } 
    ]
}
```

## Example Message Object

Hereâ€™s an example JSON object that illustrates how this structure can be populated for a payment-related use case:

```json
{
    "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "payload": "<originalMessage>...</originalMessage>",
    "tenant": "tenant_ABC",
    "origin": "banking_gateway_A",
    
    "data": {
        "transaction_id": "TX123456789",
        "amount": "1000.00",
        "currency": "USD",
        "sender_details": {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "account": "1234567890"
        },
        "receiver_details": {
            "name": "Jane Smith",
            "account": "0987654321"
        }
    },
    
    "status": "pending",
    "retries": 1,
    
    "metadata": {
        "format_version": "ISO20022:v1",
        "type": "credit_transfer",
        "priority": "real-time",
        "tags": ["international", "urgent"],
        "flags": {
            "requires_urgent_review": true
        }
    },
    
    "auditlog": [
        {
            "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:15:30Z",
            "hash": "9a6b91d2e5e6c4d59b78ecbb1f9f6c88",
            "workflow": "credit_transfer_workflow",
            "task": "initial_validation",
            "description": "Validated incoming message structure",
            "instance": "instance_001"
        },
        {
            "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:16:30Z",
            "hash": "c5d8b3e80b3d4aefc567a5ed9306a6d3",
            "workflow": "credit_transfer_workflow",
            "task": "enrichment",
            "description": "Enriched with customer account details",
            "instance": "instance_002"
        }
    ]
}
```

This Message Structure is designed to be adaptable across different domains, ensuring compliance with specific standards like ISO20022 for payments, while providing the flexibility to incorporate other formats as needed. By maintaining a clear separation between product-specific fields and domain-specific data, this structure supports multi-tenant, multi-domain use cases effectively within the Open Payments platform.
