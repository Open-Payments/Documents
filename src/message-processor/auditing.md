# Error Handling and Auditing Details

- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries processing steps that fail due to transient issues (e.g., temporary network outages, momentary service unavailability).
- **Error Queue**: A holding area for messages that cannot be processed after retries, allowing for manual review and intervention.
- **Auditing**: Every action taken on the message is logged, including timestamps, processing steps completed, errors encountered, data transformations applied, and user interventions if any.
